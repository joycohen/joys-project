        <h1> Dear diary,</h1>
        <p> Today I'm going to tell you about the things I like to do 
        during the summer. Most of the time, I like to sit on the beach
        or pool and spend time in the sun while takin advantage of the 
        weather. When the weather isn't the best out, I enjoy going to the 
        movies or to the mall with a few friends. Most of al, I love to enjoy
        myself until school starts and we won't have as much freedom anymore. </p>
